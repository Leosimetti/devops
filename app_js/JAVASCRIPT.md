### JavaScript Best Practices

- Using Pug(Jade)

> Its syntax allows for a much cleaner and functional page markup.

- Properly structuring the project

> Storing views, public, routes separately makes the project files easier to locate.

- Setting the environment to production

> Setting `NODE_ENV = production` enables many features that generally make the code run more efficiently.
