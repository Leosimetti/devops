## Why the outputs are different
> Each application tracks its "visists" separately due to the persistent volumes.
> The apps get different amounts of visits because load balancing takes places in when processing a request.
> The first replica has the least "visits" as it was selected only when the load on the services was at its peak.

## Why ordering guarantee are unnecessary
> Ordering is unimportant in our case as service instances do not share a common state -
> they are independent and can replace each other without issues.
